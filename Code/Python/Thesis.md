The concept of wobbling motion is a key feature in identifying and also understanding the deformed nuclei which exists in *stable states*.
Nuclear stability (especially for the odd nuclei) is a rather elusive phenomenon, and a tremendous effort was devoted by experimentalists and theoreticians for a concrete overview of the underlying physics that occurs.
